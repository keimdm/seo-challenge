The header for the website is displayed at the top, with the brand name Horiseon as well as a toolbar containing three links. These links can be clicked to scroll the user down to the relevant sections of the application.

Below the hero image, there is a section about different types of SEO, broken out into three subsections. Each subsection contains a title, image and brief description. Additionally, there is an aside dedicated to SEO benefits, also with three subsections. Each of those also contains a title, image and description.

A footer is placed at the bottom of the page, indicating the maker and copyright information.
